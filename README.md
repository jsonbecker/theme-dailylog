# Daily Log

A simple theme based on posts that are reverse chronological by day, but chronological within days.

What do I mean?

If you hvae three posts on January 10th and then one post on January 11th, the order of your posts are:

1. January 11th - 10am
2. January 10th - 9am
3. January 10th - 12pm
4. January 10th - 8pm

The idea is that you want to see the most recent day, but beyond that, you want to read each individual day as someone wrote it, like a daily log.
